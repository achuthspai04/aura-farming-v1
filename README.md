# [Aura Farmer] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [Smartboys]


### Team Members
- Team Lead: [Achuth S Pai] - [SCMS School of Engineering and Technology]
- Member 2: [Navaneeth Krishna] - [SCMS School of Engineering and Technology]


### Project Description
[Aura Farmer is a playful dashboard for your startup or team, designed to gamify productivity and collaboration. Team members earn or lose "Aura" points for actions, commitments, and fun in the workspace‚Äîturning everyday work into an engaging challenge!]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[How do you motivate, prank, and celebrate your colleagues in real time‚Ä¶ when Slack emojis and "good job" just don‚Äôt cut it? What if tracking memes, allegations, and helpfulness was as important as actual work? We solve the problem nobody cares about: making productivity a competition]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[One shared leaderboard! Every team member‚Äôs actions (commits, votes, memes, snacks eaten) affect their Aura score in a live dashboard. Submit allegations, give praise, and watch the whole team‚Äôs energy change. It‚Äôs part scoreboard, part chaos engine, all fun.]
